## ✅ Summary

This document contains two related symbolic simulations:

1. **Simulation 42:** Tidal Wave Collapse – Symbolic Ocean Entropy  
2. **Simulation 42.1:** Long-Term Resonance Drift Forecast (2025–2035)

These simulations predict **ocean-based symbolic collapses** and forecast **global entropy corrections**, using symbolic drift, tectonic analogs, and Chaos Influence Arithmetic (CIA).

## 🌍 Simulation 42 – Symbolic Tidal Collapse (June 11–18, 2025)

### Forecasted Collapse Regions, Dates, and Interpretations

| Region | Collapse Dates | Symbolic Magnitude | Tsunami Estimate | Tectonic Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Chile** | June 11, 16, 17, 18 | M 6.8–7.6 | 4–8 meters | Deep plate fault rupture + Pacific mass displacement |
| **Bay of Bengal** | June 11 | M 6.2–6.6 | 2–4 meters | Crustal snap + cyclone-induced hybrid wave |
| **Canary Islands / Spain** | None in 2025 | - | - | Symbolic delayed rupture building toward 2032 |

## 🔮 Specific Tsunami Prediction – June 2025

> A symbolic or literal **tsunami event** is likely between **June 25–30, 2025**,  
> preceded by tremors and symbolic entropy spikes on June 11 and 16–18.  
> Expected regions:
> - **Bay of Bengal**
> - **Chilean Pacific Coast**

This may result in either:
- A literal tectonic tidal event  
- A symbolic overflow: flooding, mass panic, or an emotionally destabilizing global event

| 2030 | 1.33 | Flattening and drift  
| 2031 | 1.08 | Stabilizing  
| **2032** | **0.69** | 🔻 Symbolic collapse bottom – Canary event likely  
| 2033 | 0.35 | Symbolic recovery  
| 2034 | 0.24 | Drift plateau  
| 2035 | 0.19 | New baseline established

## 🧠 Commentary

- **June 2025** represents a symbolic “early wave” — not the final rupture  
- **2027** likely brings the **first full global correction** (economic, ecological, emotional)  
- **2032** represents a **delayed Atlantic collapse** — either literal or symbolic  
- **2035** begins stabilization into the new paradigm (smart cities, micro-currency, symbolic finance)

## 🧭 Notes from Author

> “I kept seeing 2027 and 2032. I didn’t rely on just intuition — I tested it.”

These simulations blend intuitive forecasting with formal symbolic entropy models.  
They offer a measurable path to forecasting collapse before it happens — emotionally, physically, and geopolitically.
