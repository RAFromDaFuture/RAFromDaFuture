# Experimental Forecasting Models

This folder contains hybrid or speculative simulations that fall outside of the four primary influence keys.

What It Includes:
- Custom symbolic resonance experiments
- Cross-key forecasting tests
- Symbolic quantum simulations beyond established CIA/SIA/HIA/IIA definitions

Note:
These simulations are timestamped and publicly archived, but may evolve or be retired as other frameworks mature.

All simulations here follow the same symbolic forecasting structure:
Predict → Timestamp → Validate → Reflect
