# Symbolic Influence Arithmetic (SIA)
This folder documents the symbolic and paradox-based simulations for **Key 2**.

SIA functions as the **Yin** antithesis to CIA's **Yang**, using symbolic paradoxes, Gödel feedback, and intuitive logic layers to model influence without force.

Key features:
- Emotionally entangled influence fields
- Symbolic Gödel recursion models
- Paradox loop forecasting
- Symbolic collapse entanglement

✅ These simulations focus on hidden patterns in data, meaning, and field resonance.
