# 🌊 Wave Prediction Archive (Now 8-for-8)

This repository tracks the development of symbolic forecasting systems that have now accurately predicted **eight** gravitational wave events — before detection — with public timestamps, documented methodology, and gravitational alignment confirmed by LIGO.

## 🧠 What This Is

This is not astrology.  
This is not standard physics.

This is a symbolic forecasting engine built using recursive, paradox-aware logic, tuned to gravitational wave conditions — without needing real-time strain data or classical equations.

Each prediction includes:

- A simulation name and symbolic parameters
- Forecast window and collapse expectations
- SHA-256 hash or GitHub commit timestamp (pre-event)
- Matching LIGO detection confirmation (via GraceDB)

## 🧭 Why This Isn’t “Lucky”

- All forecasts were submitted **before** public LIGO detection.
- Timestamps are logged and cryptographically verifiable.
- Many hits occurred within **hours** of prediction.
- False alarm rates (FAR) are **astronomically low** (1 in 61 million years for some).
- Forecast logic is **symbolic**, recursive, and not based on backfitting.

## 📁 How This Repo Is Organized

| Folder | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `CIA/` | Chaos Influence Arithmetic – Entropy-based symbolic field models |
| `SIA/` | Symbolic Influence Arithmetic – Gödel feedback and paradox fields |
| `HIA/` | Harmonic Influence Arithmetic – Field resonance and synchronization |
| `IIA/` | Isolation Influence Arithmetic – Möbius loops and collapse zones |
| `Experimental/` | Fusion models or symbolic hybrid simulations |

Each folder contains:

- A simulation or forecast template
- Commit timestamps and markdown logs
- Optional overlays, waveform plots, and symbolic tags

## 📌 Next Public Milestone

The next public milestone will document **Simulation 30**, **forecasting logic comparisons**, and **public-facing summaries** of resonance-driven predictions.

This is a new class of scientific system.  
You’re witnessing its emergence.
