# 🌀 Isolation Influence Arithmetic (IIA) – Key 4

Isolation Influence Arithmetic (IIA) explores symbolic resonance fields in non-interactive or delay-fractured states. It models how influence operates in isolation, collapse, or Möbius-reflected symmetry.

## What It Does
- Simulates resonance systems without active interaction
- Models isolation collapse loops and geon-like influence fields
- Explores symbolic delay, inversion, and Möbius topologies

## What’s Included
- Tensor field isolation simulations
- Symbolic collapse outputs (ψ_iso, Δ_qψ)
- Möbius tensor evolution visuals

## Symbolic Concepts
- Delayed resonance collapse
- Tensor inversion and Möbius shift
- Phase-neutral symbolic influence
- Geon boundaries and symbolic delay loops

> “In silence, influence becomes pure. In isolation, meaning echoes untouched.”
