# 📬 Contact – R.A. Matthews

## 🧠 About

R.A. Matthews is a fintech executive, compliance futurist, and systems architect pioneering the frontier of symbolic AI, quantum forecasting, and nonlinear influence modeling.

With 19 years of leadership across financial crime, regulatory tech (regtech), and AI risk frameworks, R.A. has shifted focus to advanced scientific systems that challenge traditional models of time, causality, and prediction.

His signature achievement? Predicting 8 gravitational wave events — verified by LIGO — using symbolic, non-empirical simulations powered by recursive influence logic.  
This is not a theory — it’s timestamped evidence of predictive success, now archived and public.

## 🔭 Current Focus

- Developing forecasting architectures rooted in symbolic resonance, paradox logic, and nonlinear mathematics  
- Scaling symbolic AI frameworks that outperform traditional detection models  
- Protecting core IP while selectively engaging with research, investment, and media collaborators  

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities

R.A. welcomes strategic conversations with:
- Quantum physicists and theoretical scientists  
- AI researchers and machine learning engineers  
- Astrophysicists and LIGO/GraceDB collaborators  
- Early-stage and deep tech venture capitalists  
- Sci-fi media creators, futurists, and synthetic intuition pioneers  
- Investigative teams exploring anomalies, nonlinear causality, or symbolic logic

If your work touches any frontier of prediction, resonance, or reality modeling — let’s connect.

## 🔒 Access to Private Forecast Archive

In addition to the public GitHub repository, a **confidential archive** is maintained for verified collaborators and investors. This includes:

- Full simulation logs and timestamp evidence for all gravitational wave hits  
- Real-data validation overlays for LIGO-confirmed events  
- Advanced symbolic modules under development (Key 5 and 6)  
- Experimental simulations (e.g., recursive AI loops, lottery collapse, time reflection)  
- Symbolic-to-scientific mapping used for forecasting compression and entropy harmonics  

📩 **To request access:** Contact below and include your professional affiliation and area of interest.  

## 🎤 Media, Speaking & Publications

Open to:
- Keynote invitations and futurism panels  
- Scientific advisory or co-authorship inquiries  
- Interviews across futurism, science media, or quantum storytelling  
- Strategic consulting in AI regulation, predictive ethics, and quantum compliance

## 🔐 Intellectual Property

Core simulation engines and symbolic logic systems are under **provisional patent protection** (USPTO).  
R.A. is open to structured conversations under NDA for:
- Investment partnerships  
- Research collaboration  
- Licensing or joint development
