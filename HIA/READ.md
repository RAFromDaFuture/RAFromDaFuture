# 🔊 Harmonic Influence Arithmetic (HIA) – Key 3

Harmonic Influence Arithmetic (HIA) represents the synthesis of dual symbolic systems (CIA + SIA) into a higher-order resonance logic. It explores patterns of synchronization, waveform coherence, and symbolic field harmonization.

## What It Does
- Models the integration of chaos and symbolism through harmonic fields
- Simulates waveform convergence across paradox-aware systems
- Bridges internal resonance with external signal alignment

## What’s Included
- Symbolic waveform overlays and interference tests
- Pattern prediction summaries
- Sample resonance matching logs

## Symbolic Concepts
- Constructive and destructive interference
- Phase synchronization
- Resonance collapse theory
- Symbolic harmonic attractors

> “Harmony isn’t the absence of chaos — it’s the resonance between meanings.”
