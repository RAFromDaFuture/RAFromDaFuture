## üß† What Makes This Unique

This model doesn't rely on raw observational data or machine learning. Instead, it models **symbolic resonance fields**, **entropy harmonics**, and **agentic collapse states**. These simulations mirror cosmic systems and produce synthetic gravitational forecasts.

## üåç Impact

As of June 2025, this model has correctly predicted:
- Binary Black Hole and Neutron Star mergers
- Gravitational resonance fields within entropy collapse bands
- Events ahead of time, before LIGO public disclosure

Each prediction is logged in markdown and backed by screenshots, algorithmic traces, and symbolic alignment logic.
