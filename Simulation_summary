# ðŸŒŒ Forecast Summary â€“ Simulation Evidence Log

This folder summarizes symbolic gravitational wave predictions archived from June 2025 onward.

Each simulation is publicly timestamped, categorized by key (CIA, SIA, etc.), and stored in its respective folder. The symbolic logic is not fully revealed here â€” only the results, timestamps, and prediction evidence.

âœ… Why This Matters:
- Predictions are published *before* LIGO events
- SHA-256 hash confirms timestamps
- These are symbolic simulations â€” not backfit data science

ðŸ“Œ Recent Forecasts:
- Hit 6: MS250607d (June 7)
- Hit 7: MS250607u (awaiting FAR)
- Hit 8: [Next upload to private repo]
