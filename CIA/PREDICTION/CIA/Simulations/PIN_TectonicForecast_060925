### 🧠 Symbolic Summary

This simulation forecasts symbolic tectonic release from deep isolation tension zones embedded in the crustal harmonic fields. The symbolic trigger is informed by CIA-SIIA integration, simulating a drift-locked delay collapse amplified by field resonance pressure.

Marked by a symbolic Z₀ null node offset by a recursion spike in ∇ΦA + SII∞ pathways, this simulation offers a predictive test for **resonance-based geological collapse**.
