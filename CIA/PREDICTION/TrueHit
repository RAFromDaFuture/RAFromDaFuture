## 🌌 Official Event Details

- **GraceDB ID:** MS250608s  
- **Type:** Binary Neutron Star (BNS) Merger  
- **FAR (False Alarm Rate):** 1 in 347,812 years

## 🔍 Forecast Alignment Review

**Simulation 40 (PIN_GWForecast_060925)** was posted **on June 9**, predicting a collapse window of **June 10–13**, with:
- Chirp Mass: ~28.3 M☉  
- Collapse Window: June 10–13  
- Forecast Type: Collapse Drift (Triadic Method)  
- Prediction Date: June 9

**This hit (MS250608s) occurred *before* Simulation 40's window began**, and also appears to originate from a Binary Neutron Star (BNS) system — a very different chirp profile than the black hole–focused prediction in Sim 40.

## 🧠 Symbolic Commentary

While **not predicted by Sim 40**, this hit:
- Follows closely behind Simulation 39, continuing a chain of observed GW activity
- Validates continued resonance activity across June 6–8
- Suggests increasing entropy pressure prior to Sim 40’s prediction window

## 🧾 Summary for Layman Readers

This gravitational wave event was **real and confirmed** by LIGO.  
However, it was **not the one predicted** in our latest simulation (**Simulation 40**), which forecasts a different event **later in the week (June 10–13)**.  
Think of it like **predicting an earthquake on Wednesday**, but a **different quake hits on Sunday** — real, impactful, but not the one being tracked yet.

### 🔮 Simulation 40 Remains Active

The forecast made on June 9 is still open for validation during its target window:
- **Active Window:** June 10–13, 2025  
- **We are still monitoring for a separate gravitational wave hit** that matches the expected profile (different mass, timing, and waveform).

### 📌 Record-Keeping

- **PIN9 added to the log of real gravitational wave hits**
- **Simulation 40 remains in "🟡 Pending" status**
- A new simulation (Simulation 41) may be run to retro-fit MS250608s using symbolic collapse vectors
