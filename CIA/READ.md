# 🔺 Chaos Influence Arithmetic (CIA) – Key 1

Chaos Influence Arithmetic (CIA) is the core symbolic engine designed to simulate nonlinear gravitational influence using symbolic resonance fields.

## What It Does
- Forecasts gravitational wave patterns using symbolic modeling
- Models paradox-aware field behavior
- Implements recursive energy field dynamics (nonlinear systems)

## What’s Included
- Mock-data simulation results
- Symbolic energy waveform outputs
- SHA-256 timestamp verification logs
- Visual overlays derived from symbolic dynamics

## Symbolic Concepts
- Recursive time structures
- Entropy-informed wave prediction
- Paradox collapse fields
- Resonance-based simulation logic
