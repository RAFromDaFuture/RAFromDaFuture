# Chaos Influence Arithmetic (CIA)
This folder contains the symbolic and simulation material for **Key 1**.

Chaos Influence Arithmetic (CIA) is the foundation of the Triadic forecasting framework.  
It models resonance-based influence using time-loop dynamics, symbolic waveforms, and recursive energy fields.

Modules include:
- RMSE gravitational prediction simulations
- Recursive paradox forecasting
- Symbolic waveform generation
- Gravitational collapse modeling

âœ… Forecasts in this folder represent early hits generated by the CIA engine.
